###The Skeleton Riders

How the Fight Goes:
* Six powerful Jockies spawn with a Big Magma Cube.

* Killing the first Jokey spawns (4) big magma cubes.
* Killing the second Jokey spawns (2-5) small magma cubes and splits all big cubes into two small cubes.
* Killing the third Jokey spawns (2-5) small magma cubes.
* Killing the fourth Jokey spawns (2-5) tiny magma cubes and splits all small cubes into tiny cubes.

# Arena Notes and Ideas
*This file is meant to have quick notes and ideas for the Arena.*

##Boss Ideas

###The Skeleton Riders

How the Fight Goes:
* Six powerful Jockies spawn with a Big Magma Cube.
* Damaging the Magma Cube deals damage to the attacker and one random player.
* Magma cubes deal more damage the smaller they are; currently (10%/20%/30%) of max health. 
* Killing the first Jokey spawns (4) big magma cubes.
* Killing the second Jokey spawns (2-5) small magma cubes and splits all big cubes into two small cubes.
* Killing the third Jokey spawns (2-5) small magma cubes.
* Killing the fourth Jokey spawns (2-5) tiny magma cubes and splits all small cubes into tiny cubes.
* Killing the fifth Jokey spawns (2-5) tiny magma cubes.
* Killing the sixth Jokey wins the fight.

Notes:
* Final phase currently has a minimum of 40 tiny magma cubes.

###Petite Pete and Towering Tim

How the Fight Goes:
* Petite Peat (a baby zombie) spawns in the arena.
* After 10 seconds a dangerous sounds players to all players.
* Towering Tim (a giant zombie) spawns in the arena.
* The two zombies share a health bar.
* [Baby Zombie] is highly resistant to magical damange, but weak to physical damage.
* [Giant Zombie] is highly resistant to physical damange, but weak to magic damage.
* [Baby Zombie] can summon other zombies to fight and heal the duo. *Uncertain how healing ability will work yet.*
* [Giant Zombie] can rally the [Baby zombie] and its spawns to increase their damage.
* Killing the duo wins the fight.

###Great Slime and Absymal Cube
* A Slime and Magma Cube spawn.

##Custom Item Ideas
* Emergency Teleport - Teleports a player to a random location in the arena (will blind them for a short time after).
* Decoy Boy Troy - Spawns a cow that will draw aggro from nearby entities.
* Glistening Melon - For ten seconds, killing an enemy will heal the user by 2% max health. (50 enemies to full health)

##Various Ideas

Arena Marked by YAML File
* Create the Arenas where desired and then set their location through a YAML file.

Bonus Loot Rounds:
* Players will have an arena filled with glowstone.
* There will be a number of creatures who can damage these blocks.
* The players must fight to protect the glowstone.
* Any glowstone left after the rounds each glowstone is converted into 3 golden scraps for the players.

Chest Loot:
* At the start of the five round cycle, players can find random loot in chests.
* These chests disappear after the first round, and can destroyed.
